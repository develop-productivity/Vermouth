# Vermouth: Bridging Generative and Discriminative Models for Unified Visual Perception with Diffusion Priors | IJCAI2024
This is office PyTorch implementation for Vermouth that was accepted by IJCAI2024.

Vermouth is a simple yet effective framework to migrate the diffusion model to non-generated tasks, which comprising a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a unified head (U-head) capable of integrating hierarchical representations, and an adapted expert providing discriminative priors
